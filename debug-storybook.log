[16:23:42.110] [INFO] Upgrading from 7.6.20 to 9.1.3
[16:23:42.116] [ERROR] Blockers detected

Storybook has found potential blockers that need to be resolved before upgrading:

vite version < 5.0.0 support removed

Support for vite version < 5.0.0 has been removed.
Storybook needs a minimum version of 5.0.0, but you have version 4.5.14.

Affected projects: /.storybook

After addressing this, you can try running the upgrade command again. You can also rerun the upgrade command with the --force flag to skip the blocker check and to proceed with the upgrade.
